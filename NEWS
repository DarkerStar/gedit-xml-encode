Version 0.1-alpha ------------------------------------------------- [2012-11-08]

*   New gedit plugin that adds a command to convert XML special characters
    ("&", "<", ">", "'" and """) in a section, or the whole document, into
    character entities. Requires [gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/).
    
*   When installed and activated (in the Plugins tab in the gedit Preferences
    dialog (Edit->Preferences)), this plugin adds a new menu item - when there
    is a document open - with a submenu with two options. One option converts
    XML special characters in the current selection. The other converts XML
    special characters in the whole document.
